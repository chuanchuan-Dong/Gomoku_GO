# Refined Monte-Carlo Tree Search Algorithm in Gomoku


This project explores the development of an AI system capable of mastering Gomoku (Five in a Row) using a refined Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. Given the computational complexity of fully traversing the Monte-Carlo Tree, we propose enhancements to the standard MCTS framework, including heuristic knowledge incorporation and optimized roll-out policies, to improve decision-making and convergence speed.

* Enhanced MCTS Algorithm: Integrates domain-specific heuristic knowledge for improved decision-making.

* Refined Roll-out Policy: Limits search depth strategically to balance efficiency and effectiveness.

* Strategic Gameplay: AI demonstrates a balance between offense and defense, recognizing traps and making optimal moves.
